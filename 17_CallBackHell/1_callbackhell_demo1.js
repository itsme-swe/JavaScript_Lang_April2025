/*
Here we are writing steps how we placed the order on ecom website.
1Ô∏è‚É£ We add items in cart.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Then we create order.
3Ô∏è‚É£ And, then we proceed to payment

So to achieve these steps callback hell comes in picture.

üí• Callback hell -- "Callback hell," also known as the "pyramid of doom," refers to a situation in programming where multiple nested callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations, making the code difficult to read, understand, and maintain.

const cart = ["shoes", "t-shirt", "watch", "laptop bag"]; // ‚á® items added to the cart

// Here 'makePayment' is the callback function
api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.makePayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.updateWallet();
    });
  });
});
