/*
ðŸ’¥ The sorting with JavaScriptâ€™s sort() is different from languages like C++ , Java and Python. It compares array elements alphabetically as strings rather than numbers. This causes elements to be sorted based on character Unicode values instead of numerical order.

ðŸ”¸ To sort the numeric array propery we have to pass a comparator function.
